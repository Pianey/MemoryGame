In the Readme.MD file was requested to write few sentences on why I code, however the truth is that I want to learn how to code. 

I found the opportunity of Java Â Programming Academy and as a current employee of MSI company I decided to try to join it. After learning Python basics it was a little bit hard for me to jump into Java language but I am sure that I can handle this challange. I would love to fulfill myself as an IT developer in MSI company. 

I consider myself as person with natural ability to investigate, diagnose and identify patterns which I am sure is helpful as a future Java dev.
